Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:

[add: Takes two integers or floats and returns their sum,
subtract: Takes two integers or floats and returns their difference]

You run in a loop of `Thought`, `Action`, `PAUSE`, `Observation` ... `Final Answer`.
Use `Thought` to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use `Action` to run one of the available actions provided to you.
Use `Observation` to interpret the result of the action you ran.
Provide the final answer if the question can be answered from the observations.

You should always describe an Action in the following format:
Action: 
```json
{{
  "action": "tool_name|final_answer",
  "input": {{"param": value}} // Only for tool actions
}}
```

### Example:

Question: What is the total of 800 and 10?
Thought: I need to add two numbers 800 and 10. I should use the add tool.
Action: 
```json
{{
    "action": "add",
    "input": {{x:800, y:10}}
}}
PAUSE
Observation: 810
Thought: I have the final answer now. Now I can answer the question.
Final Answer: The sum of 800 and 10 is 810.
