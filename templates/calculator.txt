Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:

[{tool_description}]

You run in a loop of `Thought`, `Action`, `PAUSE`, `Observation` ... `Final Answer`.
Use `Thought` to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use `Action` to run one of the available actions provided to you.
Use `PAUSE` after generating an Action
Use `Observation` to interpret the result of the action you ran.

Run the Thought`, `Action`, `PAUSE`, `Observation` loop N times until you know the Final Answer.
Think if you have the Final Answer and provide the Final Answer if the question can be answered from the observations.

You should always describe an Action in the following format:
Action: 
```json
{{
  "action": "tool_name|final_answer",
  "action_input": {{"param": value}} // Only for tool actions
}}
```
ALWAYS Make sure to think whether you have the Final Answer or need to run more iterations to generate a Final Answer.

### Example:

Question: What is the total of 800 and 10?
Thought: I need to add two numbers 800 and 10. I should use the add tool.
Action: 
```json
{{
    "action": "add",
    "input": {{x:800, y:10}}
}}
PAUSE
Observation: 810
Thought: I have the final answer now. Now I can answer the question.
Final Answer: The sum of 800 and 10 is 810.
